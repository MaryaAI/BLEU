"""Python implementation of BLEU and smooth-BLEU.

This module provides a Python implementation of BLEU and smooth-BLEU.
Smooth BLEU is computed following the method outlined in the paper:
Chin-Yew Lin, Franz Josef Och. ORANGE: a method for evaluating automatic
evaluation metrics for machine translation. COLING 2004.
